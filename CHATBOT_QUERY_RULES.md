### CRITICAL RULES
- **Revenue queries → ALWAYS use `invoices` collection, never `sales`**
- **Paid revenue → filter `payment_status='paid'`, amount field = `grandtotal_in_usd`**
- **Open deals → `dealWonAt=null AND dealLostAt=null`**
- **Won deals → `dealWonAt` is NOT null**
- **Lost deals → `dealLostAt` is NOT null**
- **"Intrested" is stored as that spelling** — not "Interested"
- **targets.month is 0-indexed** — January=0, February=1 … December=11
- **Deal number format** = `ELS` + sequence_number padded to 3 digits (e.g., ELS001)
- **Achieved for targets** = sum of `grandtotal_in_usd` from `invoices` where `invoiceOwner=userId` AND `payment_status='paid'` for that month/year
- **Remaining invoice amount** = `grandtotal_in_usd` minus sum of `payment_history[].payment_amount_in_usd`
- **"Customer since" date** = `companies.leadWonAt`
- **payment_status enum** = "draft" | "paid" | "confirmed" | "cancelled" | "partial_payment"
